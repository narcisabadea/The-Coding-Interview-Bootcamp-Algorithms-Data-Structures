# Graph

A non-linear data structure can be undirected and directed graphs because they consist of a fixed set of vertices and a set of edges. The most important thing to note is that they always have a pairwise relation of edges(arcs) and vertices(nodes).

## Use cases of a Graph

There are many use cases of the Graph data structure, especially in social networks. For example, on Facebook, each user is represented as a vertex, details like id, name, address are held in it. The relationship between two entities is connected using the edge.

Another use case is in precedence constraints. For example, at University you have to pass a level course before you can take a higher-level course. Some courses precede others which define constraints.

Road networks also use graphs where cities/towns can be vertices and the roads linking them can be the edges.

## Types of Graphs

A Graph can be divided into directed and undirected:

- Directed graph: The directed graph is also called the di-graph which has a pair of ordered vertices. The order of the vertices is really important here. In the image below, (1) the directional edge shows that A has a relationship with B but B does not have a relationship with A.
- Undirected graph: In this graph, pairs have unordered vertices and the edges are not directional. In the image below, (4) the directional edge shows that A and B both have a relationship.
