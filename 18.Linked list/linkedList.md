# Linked list

A linked list is a linear data structure similar to an array. However, unlike arrays, elements are not stored in a particular memory location or index. Rather each element is a separate object that contains a pointer or a link to the next object in that list.

Each element (commonly called nodes) contains two items: the data stored and a link to the next node. The data can be any valid data type.

The entry point to a linked list is called the head. The head is a reference to the first node in the linked list. The last node on the list points to null. If a list is empty, the head is a null reference.

In JavaScript, a linked list looks like this:

```js
const list = {
    head: {
        value: 6
        next: {
            value: 10                                             
            next: {
                value: 12
                next: {
                    value: 3
                    next: null	
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

## An advantage of Linked Lists

Nodes can easily be removed or added from a linked list without reorganizing the entire data structure. This is one advantage it has over arrays.

## Disadvantages of Linked Lists

Search operations are slow in linked lists. Unlike arrays, random access of data elements is not allowed. Nodes are accessed sequentially starting from the first node.
It uses more memory than arrays because of the storage of the pointers.

## Types of Linked Lists

There are three types of linked lists:

- Singly Linked Lists: Each node contains only one pointer to the next node. This is what we have been talking about so far.
- Doubly Linked Lists: Each node contains two pointers, a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node.
- Circular Linked Lists: Circular linked lists are a variation of a linked list in which the last node points to the first node or any other node before it, thereby forming a loop.

## Some LinkedList methods
- size()
- clear()
- getLast()
- getFirst()

## Exercise:

Implement classes Node and Linked Lists
See 'directions' document

## Solution

```js
class Node {
  constructor(data, next = null) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }

  insertFirst(data) {
    this.head = new Node(data, this.head);
  }

  size() {
    let counter = 0;
    let node = this.head;

    while (node) {
      counter++;
      node = node.next;
    }

    return counter;
  }

  getFirst() {
    return this.head;
  }

  getLast() {
    if (!this.head) {
      return null;
    }

    let node = this.head;
    while (node) {
      if (!node.next) {
        return node;
      }
      node = node.next;
    }
  }

  clear() {
    this.head = null;
  }

  removeFirst() {
    if (!this.head) {
      return;
    }

    this.head = this.head.next;
  }

  removeLast() {
    if (!this.head) {
      return;
    }

    if (!this.head.next) {
      this.head = null;
      return;
    }

    let previous = this.head;
    let node = this.head.next;
    while (node.next) {
      previous = node;
      node = node.next;
    }
    previous.next = null;
  }

  insertLast(data) {
    const last = this.getLast();

    if (last) {
      // There are some existing nodes in our chain
      last.next = new Node(data);
    } else {
      // The chain is empty!
      this.head = new Node(data);
    }
  }

  getAt(index) {
    let counter = 0;
    let node = this.head;
    while (node) {
      if (counter === index) {
        return node;
      }

      counter++;
      node = node.next;
    }
    return null;
  }

  removeAt(index) {
    if (!this.head) {
      return;
    }

    if (index === 0) {
      this.head = this.head.next;
      return;
    }

    const previous = this.getAt(index - 1);
    if (!previous || !previous.next) {
      return;
    }
    previous.next = previous.next.next;
  }

  insertAt(data, index) {
    if (!this.head) {
      this.head = new Node(data);
      return;
    }

    if (index === 0) {
      this.head = new Node(data, this.head);
      return;
    }

    const previous = this.getAt(index - 1) || this.getLast();
    const node = new Node(data, previous.next);
    previous.next = node;
  }

  forEach(fn) {
    let node = this.head;
    let counter = 0;
    while (node) {
      fn(node, counter);
      node = node.next;
      counter++;
    }
  }

  *[Symbol.iterator]() {
    let node = this.head;
    while (node) {
      yield node;
      node = node.next;
    }
  }
}
```
