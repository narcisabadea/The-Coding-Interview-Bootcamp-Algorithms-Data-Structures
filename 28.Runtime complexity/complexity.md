# Runtime complexity

Describes the performance of an algorithm.

For exemple:

- reversing a string: Each additional character = 1 step through 1 loop so it would be 'N', or 'linear' runtime.
- printing steps: As 'n' increased by one, we had to do more things, or (n\*n) things total so it would be N^2, or quadratic runtime.

# Data Structures

Ways of organizing information with optimal 'runtime complexity' for adding or removing records.
Data structures can be divided into two categories: linear and non-linear. Both Graph and Trees are non-linear as their elements do not form a sequence.
